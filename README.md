# Minesweeper Studio

Browser-based Minesweeper with a "beautification studio": every visual polish
feature (themes, textures, typography, motion, HUD styles, cursor, ambience,
etc.) is optional, reversible, and persisted.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Other useful commands:

```bash
npm run test
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Controls (target)

- Left click / tap: reveal
- Right click / long-press: flag
- Chord: reveal neighbors when flags match a number (gesture varies by platform)
- Keyboard: `R` restart; `1`/`2`/`3` presets (Beginner/Intermediate/Expert)

## Notes

- Visual settings are always optional and must not reduce readability or
  performance.
